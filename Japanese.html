				<h2 class="title">Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
				<p class="text_1">Hayao Miyazaki cemented animation as a medium and genre that is just as worthy of acclaim as any other film.
					The Japanese animator is the co-founder of Studio Ghibli, perhaps the most well-known film and animation 
					studio in Japan. His notable works are: Spirited Away(2001), My Neighbour Totoro (1988), Prince's Mononoke 
					(1997).</p>

					<h2 class="title">Makoto Shinkai</h2>
					<p class="text_2">When someone is praised as the "second Miyazaki," every fan of anime should pay attention, and Makoto Shinkai 
						is definitely a big name in modern anime. Shinkai's two most famous works are 2016's Your Name and 2019's 
						Weathering With You.</p>

						<h2 class="title">Satoshi Kon</h2>
						<p class="text_1">
							At the other end of the spectrum of feature-length anime films are the works of Satoshi Kon. Two of his works 
				    (Perfect Blue and Paprika) have even influenced Hollywood directors like Darren Aronofsky and Christopher Nolan.

							<h2 class="title">Yasujirô Ozu</h2>
							<p class="text_2">
								Tokyo-born Yasujiro Ozu was a movie buff from childhood, often playing hooky from school in order to see Hollywood movies in his local theatre. In 1923 he landed a job as a camera assistant at Shochiku Studios in Tokyo.

								<h2 class="title">Kenji Mizoguchi</h2>
								<p class="text_1">
									Coming from a lower class family Mizoguchi entered the production company Nikkatsu as an actor specialized in female roles. Later he became an assistant director and made his first film in 1922. Although he filmed almost 90 movies in the silent era, only his last 12 productions are really known outside of Japan because they were especially produced for Venice (e.g. The Life of Oharu (1952) or 0047445. He only filmed two productions in color: Princess Yang Kwei-fei (1955) and Taira Clan Saga (1955).

									<h2 class="title">Ishirô Honda</h2>
									<p class="text_2">
										Influential Japanese film director born May 7th, 1911, often credited as being the father of Godzilla. His name is a combination of "I" (or Ino), meaning "boar" and "shirô," meaning fourth boy in the family. Originally, the young Honda had aspirations of becoming a painter. However, as he moved into his teens, it was cinema that became his number-one interest.

										<img class="gallery_image" src="images/kon.jpg" alt="Kon Ichikawa"/>
										<div class="flex_text">
										<h2 class="title">Kon Ichikawa</h2>
										<p class="text_1">
											Kon Ichikawa has been influenced by artists as diverse as Walt Disney and Jean Renoir, and his films cover a wide spectrum of moods, from the comic to the overwhelmingly ironic and even the perverse. Ichikawa began his career as a cartoonist, and this influence is apparent in his skillful use of the widescreen, and in the strong, angular patterns seen in many of his compositions. He has directed Mr. Pu (1953), a popular film based on Junichi Yokoyama's "Mr. Pu" comic strip.

											<h2 class="title">Masaki Kobayashi</h2>
											<p class="text_2">
												Masaki Kobayashi was born on February 14, 1916 in Hokkaido, Japan. He was a director and writer, known for Hara-Kiri (1962), Samurai Rebellion (1967) and The Human Condition I: No Greater Love (1959). He died on October 4, 1996 in Tokyo, Japan.

												<div class="flex_text">
												<h2 class="title">Hiroshi Inagaki</h2>
												<p class="text_1">
													Inagaki's career in film began as an actor--a child actor, in fact, appearing in numerous silent films beginning at the very dawn of Japanese cinema. This is probably why he was promoted to director at the unusually (for Japan) young age of 22. Along with producer Mansaku Itami (later the father of another acclaimed director, Juzo Itami), Inagaki concerned himself with the genre of Japanese period films. He also wrote (under a pseudonym) similar films for the short-lived director Sadao Yamanaka.
